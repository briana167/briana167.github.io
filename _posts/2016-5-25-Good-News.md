title: Good news, everyone!
---

Okay, but this is actually good news. I feel overwhelmingly blessed and grateful to be able to say that I'll be starting as a cohort[5] member @ Ada Developers Academy in August! Here's a rundown of my journey (warning: this goes way back) to get to this point.

I've always been fascinated by tech, but played a little dancing game on how I would break into the field. 

**High School**  
In my junior year of high school, a glimmer of a potential path popped up. I had applied at [Youth Force](http://teenjobs.org/) for a gig working at Seahawks games, but they got back to me and said "Hey, we also have this marketing internship thing we're trying to start at Microsoft, are you interested?" Of course, my answer was a resounding "YES!" Mind you, this was my first ever job interview for my first ever job. I went through an interview (and interview prep) at Youth Force, then a round of interviews at Microsoft. I got a spot in this pilot program and was placed in the Developer & Platform Evangelism division (I had no clue what any of these words meant). This experience was awesome, I still feel so lucky to this day to have been a part of it. I got to collaborate often with the three other apprentices and dive into topics/projects I had zero experience in (I distinctly remember franctically searching how to build a SharePoint website). The program was so generous in allowing us to explore our interests, I remember I really wanted to learn about the Xbox division and they let me shadow someone from the Xbox marketing team. While I cannot express enough how amazing the program is (it's still going, support [Youth Force](http://teenjobs.org/)!), I realized marketing wasn't for me. 

**University**  
With marketing crossed off my list, I knew I didn't want to go to business school. Going into the University of Washington, I thought I was going to major in Psychology. It was intriguing and I liked the research elements, but the end point of being a psychologist didn't appeal to me. I switched gears to Communication since I adored rhetoric (or any type of wordplay, really), and my fascination with political rhetoric drove me to add Political Science as my second major. The manifestation of my interests could be characterized through my curiosity around the SOPA/PIPA debate - the perfect combo of tech, politics, and rhetoric. At this point, I still didn't have a career in mind. I actually wandered a bit and became interested in screenwriting, but that settled into a hobby despite looking into that career path.  I graduated without a plan, which was terrifying. 

**Pre-Career**  
I applied to *so* many positions. I still have the folder with all the different cover letters I wrote. Luckily, I had landed a communications internship at the City of Kirkland just prior to graduating. During that internship, I was given some creative freedom in what stories I wanted to cover. I chose [TEALS](https://www.tealsk12.org/), an awesome program where software engineers volunteer to teach computer science at high schools very early in the AM, then go to their regular jobs for the rest of the day. I was so psyched that this program was at the high school I went to (and secretly very jealous, they didn't have it when I was there). In reaching out to them for the story, I was put in touch with a Microsoft PR contact. I noticed she worked for Waggener Edstrom Communications (now [WE Communications](https://www.we-worldwide.com/)) and thought "her job seems cool..." In the many, many applications that I filled out post-graduation, Waggener Edstrom Communications was one of the only employers that I got to interview with. I got into their internship program and am so thankful that they gave me my big tech break.

**Career[0]**  
The internship program at WE Communications is crazy good. I got to do team projects with the other interns and also rotate on a number of teams. This position was immensely helpful in building up my skills in teamwork, strategy, and overall professionalism. At the end of the internship I ranked which teams I was interested in joining. I was torn between Developer Communications and Reactive Issues, but ultimately went with the latter and happily accepted the job offer to join them. This is where I was introduced to the world of cybersecurity and I was *hooked*. I built up very, very rudimentary learnings about this world and wanted more. This is where the frustration set in, I would watch infosec lectures and nothing would stick. It felt like to know security, I would first need to know programming, and to know programming...well, I didn't even know where to start. When you're not in a school setting, the plethora of resources is overwhelming. I couldn't even wrap my head around what programming language to start with. I started taking online lecture-style courses but I still felt lost. Eventually, my reactive PR role felt repetitive so I went to a more proactive PR role at Edelman. Spoiler alert: this still left me wanting to learn programming.

**Limbo**  
Eventually I discovered more hands-on learning websites like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), [The Odin Proejct](http://www.theodinproject.com/), and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). This is where I actually felt like things were sticking - they allowed me the venue to try things for myself instead of just sitting back and watching a lecture. This is also where I had trouble controlling my hunger for learning.  Eventually I succombed - that is, to trying to control my hunger. I quit my job and dedicated myself to online learning. I relentlessly researched my options - boot camps, post-bacc programs, online certificates, etc. I had known about Ada Developers Academy for a while (I almost applied to Cohort 5!), and after looking into all my options I knew Ada was what I wanted. I'll do a whole post on my research into Ada and the application process, because that itself was a doozy!

**Present**  
Finally, I feel like I'm where I've always wanted to be. I'm super psyched (and a bit nervous) to start in August! I'll do my best to try to jot down my experiences here.
