title: Applying to Ada Developers Academy
---

<p>Here are a handful of things I did before/during the ADA application process.</p>

<p><i>(Side note: isn't it fun how ADA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym">recursive acronym</a>?)</i></p>

<p>This is what I personally did for my application, but the best thing to do is check out the 
"Applicants" section of the <a href"http://adadevelopersacademy.org/applicants">Ada Developers Academy website</a> if you 
haven't already, especially the "Target Student" info. Feel free to reach out via <a href="https://twitter.com/briana_eng">Twitter</a> 
if you have any questions &#9786;</p>

<h4>Try out courses/lessons</h4>
<p>Utilizing sites like Codecademy an Free Code Camp allow you to self-test aptitude and enthusiasm, both of 
which will be key for the application process. Personally, I completed a couple courses on 
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> (Ruby & Git) and was at the basic algorithm section of 
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">FCC</a> before I applied. There are a bunch of other sites out there though, so just find what 
suits your learning style the best. That being said, getting through as much of 
<a href="https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start">Jump Start</a> is something that I recommend above all when 
it comes to technical prep. The application process specifically says Phase 2 is "based on our Jump Start Curriculum" and getting through 
most of Jump Start helped me so much during Phase 2.</p>

<h4>Research the culture/program</h4>
<p>Lots of Adies have blogs with their experiences, a quick Google search will lead you to them (and they link to others). 
There was an awesome <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/special-coverage/this-woman-codes/">series on Geekwire</a> 
about one student's journey as well! You can also reach out to Adies via Twitter or LinkedIn - I chose the latter and ended up grabbing coffee 
with a couple of them to pick their brains. Some Adies even go to local tech meet-ups so you'd most likely run into a few if you immerse yourself 
in the Seattle tech community. Hearing/reading about personal experiences will help you figure out if you'll enjoy the environment - I got the feeling of 
"I want to be friends with all of these people" which made me even more excited to apply!</p>

<h4>Get a head start</h4>
<p>The Ada Developers Academy website does a great job laying out the different phases. That info wasn't on the site when I initially 
applied, so I went a bit crazy looking into the online application (aka Phase 1). I used the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive/Wayback Machine</a> 
to look at some of the past applications. Here are my thoughts for each section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><u>Resume</u>: The req of a resume in Markdown on GitHub was a given for all the application cycles, so I completed that before the 
  application period was open. Play around with it and make sure everything looks good. Google will be your friend here.</li>
  <li><u>Technical</u>: Through the archive I also found one of the past data set portions, so I did that in preparation even though 
  my data set would likely be different. As you do this section, document what you're doing (or tried) and why you're doing it. It will be so much  
  easier to jot notes about your process as you go versus doing it all and forgetting about what you attempted/why you attempted it. Use Google, but also use YouTube - I found 
  video tutorials to be helpful in this section.</li>
  <li><u>Essays</u>: For the essay portion, there were a bunch of different questions used throughout the years, so I decided to just do a braindump. That braindump went through all the questions and more, so I would be able 
to grab different thought nuggets when it came time to address the short essay questions in my application. This braindump was helpful multiple times in the application process (especially the interview phase), 
I recommend doing this no matter what. It's rather cathartic and helps you stay focused on why you want this - it'll help your grit and passion shine through everything you do in the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this preparation helped me tremendously, as completing your application in a thorough and efficient manner is important since it's rolling admissions.</p>

<h4>Stay sane</h4>
<p>The Ada Developers Academy application process is intense, but well worth it. Not only because of the chance to get into such an 
awesome program, but also the self-reflection it prompts. Remember to tell yourself "you can do this" and re-read your braindump to stay 
motivated. Every time I submitted for a phase, I felt so ridiculously nervous afterwards. That's normal. When I would feel a bit more panicky I'd just 
tell myself "what's the worst that can happen, I don't get in <i>this time</i>?" and chill out, because I knew this is what I wanted and 
I'd simply try again if it didn't happen this time. Take a break and watch a TV show or read a book when you need to!</p>
