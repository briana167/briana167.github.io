title: Online learning resources

Since I did a bunch of poking around to find different resources, I thought I'd share them! The ones with asterisks are the ones
I personally enjoyed the most.

I also recommend putting together a doc with your research, so it's easier to compare. For example, below is an excerpt of my research doc (meant to just show the type of info, but if you want my doc just contact me). Please note that this data could be out-of-date by now!
